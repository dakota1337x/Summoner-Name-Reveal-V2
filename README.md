Hello all, I was tired of having to use external programs to see summoner's names and quick stats during ranked gameplay and I just wanted to see it in chat like TeamInsightX used to do before the recent Riot ID changes. I took it upon myself to update and tweak some thing, it's not nearly as full featured as TeamInsightX but it gets the job done.

Features:

-See hidden users names in champ select.

-See quick stats like Rank, Win Rate, Commonly Played Lane, and KDA over the past 20 ranked games.

-Open a link directly to op.gg to see extended stats.


FYI:

-It will show N/A or say Unranked if there is not enough recent data to pull from, please refer to the link in chat to see more detailed information about a champ.

Bugs:

-IDK comment here!

Install Instructions:

Click the download link above and select the download icon in the top left hand corner.

After downloading please open the Pengu loader and select the "Plugins" tab.

After that select the "Open folder" button at the bottom of the program.

Drag and drop the downloaded "Summoner Name Reveal V2.js" into that folder.

Thats all! Below is a short GIF on installation.
